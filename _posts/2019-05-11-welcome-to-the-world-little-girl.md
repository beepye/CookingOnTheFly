At first it seems it's going to be a breeze, right? Just going throught the motions. You've been there before, this damn sure ain't your first rodeo - hell, you've been on this bull a few times now and it hasn't kicked you off â€“ so the approach is simple. We're going to crush this kiddo number 3 thing. Kick it right in the nads.

After the smoothest labor my wife has had - and I caught the baby myself (watching that event was mind blowing) - and the dust settles I look at Ronnie cuddling the new baby and find myself incredibly content with this new life situation. Yet at the same time I managed to ponder a looming question.

> Who in the _hell_ would let this happen? What fool would give me 3 girls?

And I said it out loud. Ronnie, my wife, said "well I guess I did..." - I told her I was really talking to God if there is one. It's a crazy thing to be a parent and the responsibility that comes along with it - "heavy lies the crown" so to speak. Managing multiple means you have multiple humans you could _completely_ screw up if you don't mind the p's and q's. There's definitely a line you have to walk consistently and it's as thin as the floss some girls call a bathing suit (if you're a dude I'm fairly certain of the mental image I just painted).
