I didn't get any _real_ chef'ing experience until I was hired at Expressions where fine dining and I met for the first time. Expressions was a quiant and quiet restaurant that was connected to a fine arts center tucked away in the suburbs of Glen Allen, Virgina. It was mostly an older clientel that frequented the restaurant and arts center; many weeks we had groups of seniors come in still wearing clothing and accessories from a by-gone era (I'm talking about you, Red Hat Ladies). There were a few banquet halls for weddings and celebrations and the restaurant did all the catering for them (it was the prime stream of income for the owner). It all seemed a normal place until you got to know the staff, but isn't that the case at all restaurant establishments?

My first experience of employee kookiness was the quick recognition that the current head chef was a raging drunk. It was common for mornings in the kitchen to have a lingering musk of blackberry Schnapp's and cigarettes hanging like fog on the Charles during a New England sunrise. I was even lucky enough to catch him passed out against a cooler unit once where he had attempted to manually light the fryer's pilot and apparently thought a nap was called for after the strenuous task (sarcasm). Good ol' Doug, I wonder if he's still alive - what a mess that guy was.

A new head chef was hired, because obviously the other guy had to go, was a younger fella from NY with a vision and the gung-ho to see it through. This gent taught me a lot – both good and not-so-much so – but we had a f*cking blast and became good friends pretty swiftly (shout out to Matt if you're reading this). So many laughs, and drinks, were had in that kitchen. It eventually brought about the idea of "The Skippy Breadcrumbs Show" where an idiot and a chef taught viewers the dangers of the restaurant kitchens – it was funny as hell, at least to us.

Expressions was where the magic happened for me. I learned how to actually cook. I learned about menu creation (we had a rotating seasonal menu); how to be creative with recipes; garnishing plates for visual appeal; making desserts and dessert decoration; and of course how to drink copious amounts of Jim Beam in very little Coke - I even had my own bottle at the bar.

Expressions was indeed the complete course in restaurant 101.
