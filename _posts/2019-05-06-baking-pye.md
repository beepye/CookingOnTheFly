## Cooking Has Always Been a Big Part of My Life   

The smell of baking bread fills the kitchen and surrounding rooms making for a pleasant aroma in the morning. I've got my first boule of my latest sourdough batch baking and the heat that escapes the oven is still welcome on these cool, crisp, mornings of May in New England. There's no better mix of sensations to enjoy while starting your Saturday or Sunday (or any day for that matter).

Cooking has always been a big part of my life - "huge" might describe it better but I don't want to be sensational about it. At both the low points and the high points in my life it makes it's appearances. At times it's a stress reliever and outlet. Other times it's for fellowship and sharing. No matter what the situation is cooking has always been there for me.

## Early Years in the Restaurant Industry

I began down the path of cooking (or "culinary arts" to throw some glitter on it) in my mid-to-late teen years when my step-father's 15th birthday present to me was a *Worker's Permit. At the time it seemed appalling to spend my precious summers working in the dregs with the "adults" rather than shredding the streets with my buddies and our skateboards. However in later years I would change my mind about this with the moniker "it gave me character", in which I genuinely feel it did. It also shaped some of my future for both the good and bad.

I started off that summer as a bus boy - is that even politically correct to say now? - at a local Shoney's and eventually worked my way to dishwasher, then line cook, then lead cook. The cast of characters, otherwise known as employees, provided daily entertainment: the dishwasher on LSD; the 3 brothers from the local hood (that were my line cooks) breaking out into fights in the middle of a Friday night rush; the 2 sisters who were swingers; coke in the manager's office (not the soda); the 2 knuckleheads who got jobs as dishwashers who then broke into the building and stole the restaurant safe that was empty a few weeks later. Lot's of good times, these are just a few (I could write a book, literally)!

Whether good for me or bad for me the restaurant world exposed me to and gave me my love for cooking. It's what birthed it, and I'm grateful for the time spent covered in the trenches covered in sweat and grease.

<aside class="aside-reference">* In Virginia, at least during the 90s, in order to work under the age of 16 years old one had to have a valid Worker's Permit. Granted you weren't eligible for it until you were 15 - it was only good for a year (enter eye-roll emoji here).<aside>
