In general when someone considers a hospital thoughts surface of a place where all aspects of health are at the forefront of thought; folks are on the mend and are there to get better. Recovery is a part of health, right? So why on Earth are these places of healing ignoring one of the bedrocks, one of the cornerstones, of human health and recovery?

> "Let food be thy medicine, and medicine be thy food" is a famous quote from Hippocrates, a legendary Greek physician who is largely considered to be the father of western medicine. As far back as 460 BC it was understood that food was a massively important factor to your health. So why in this era are we still turning a blind eye to that fact in one of our most fundamental institutions?

There's all sorts of old jokes about hospitals and the food they serve patients (staff too). With everything now known in the mainstream circles of holistic health about the food one consumes jokes about hospital food shouldn't should be relics, not reality. In all seriousness if you come to a place to get better, to heal, then greasy cheap fried food, candy and sugary drinks, etc, shouldn't be on the menu â€“ _at all_.

Personally I believe diets at hospitals should be based around a patients individual needs and/or preferences (providing they are healthy preferences). There should be different types of meals available for everyone; vegetarian, vegan, paleo, low-carb/low-cal, etc. I don't think they need to be uber extensive, that may not be plausible, but a basic coverage of these diet types should be mandatory (and no, salads don't suffice as a vegetarian/vegan option). Basic food groups of protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs consisting of whole, real foods should be the foundational ingredients. Not highly processed "foods". At a minimum there should be healthier options to _at least_ offset the garbage for those who are "food quality conscious". And speaking of quality, it shouldn't be the dregs, either.

> Another point of view to consider is _ethics_? Is it considered ethical to give food that is known to be detrimental to one's health to people who are sick, injured, or trying to recover in some shape or form? 

Personally I would think not but if I _am_ wrong then it's at least _questionable_. Doesn't it send the wrong message to the many who just don't have any knowledge or education around food and health? If a place you go to to heal is serving McDonald's _what does that really say_? I think it would be easy to misconstrue it leading many unwitting people astray. Questionable at minimum.
